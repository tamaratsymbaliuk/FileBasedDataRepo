# 📁 Simple File-Based Database (Java)

This is a **simple file-based database system** built in Java that supports basic **CRUD** operations. It uses object serialization for persistent storage and follows a **repository pattern** for data management.

## ✨ Features

- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations
- File-based data persistence using Java Serialization
- Supports multiple entity types (e.g. Academy, Group, Course, Mentor)
- Basic querying logic (e.g. `getMentorsByAcademyId`)
- Easy to extend with new entity types
- Clean separation of concerns using repository interfaces

## 📦 Future Enhancements
Replace serialization with JSON or a lightweight embedded database (like H2 or SQLite)

Add search and filter functionality

Introduce transactional logic or history tracking
